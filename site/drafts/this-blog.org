** Slick vs Hakyll

Hakyll's "DSL" makes it easy to get up-and-running if you follow established patterns, but it's implemented in a sufficiently mystical fashion to make changing or adding functionality a real headache.

Slick, on the other hand, is much easier to grok; it essentially consists of some utilities to glue together well-established libraries and tools:
- Pandoc to convert between the markup language and HTML
- Mustache for templating
- Shake for building and caching the output files
- Aeson to manipulate JSON at various stages.
A slick blog requires a few more lines and bit more understanding on the part of the author, but in my view it is easier and more transparent in the long run.
